<h2> Description</h2>
<p> This is a basic example of how to use a Decision Tree to model Bank of America (BoA) daily stock prices. 
We will build a very simple model that uses four technical indicators to predict
whether the dayâ€™s price will close up or down. We will also demonstrate how to prune the decision tree.
We don't expect this model to perform well on new, out-of-sample data with purpose being to 
demonstrate how to build these type of models. </p>
