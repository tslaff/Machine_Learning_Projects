<h1>Machine Learning Projects </h1>

<h2> Original Post</h2>
<p> All work originally done for the [Inovance blog](https://inovancetech.com/blogtitles.html) </p>

<h2> Description</h2>
<p> The purpose of these projects was to demonstrate, conceptually, how traders
could apply machine-learning algorithms and techniques to their own trading. **These
models are not meant to be used on a live strategy and the underlying principles
should be carefully studied before application.**</p>

<p> Machine-learning algorithms and techniques can be a powerful tool in many
pursuits, especially in the world of finance, and I am passionate about making 
these techniques more accessible. Contact me at t.slaff@inovancetech.com, twitter at
