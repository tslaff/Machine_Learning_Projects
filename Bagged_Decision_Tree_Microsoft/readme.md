<h2> Description</h2>
<p> This is a basic example of how to use a Bagged Decision Tree to model Microsoft (NASDACQ:MSFT) daily stock prices. 
We will build a very simple model that uses four technical indicators to predict
whether the dayâ€™s price will close up or down then we will show how building features based off the
indicators greatly increases the models performance. We don't expect this model to perform well on new, 
out-of-sample data with purpose being to demonstrate how to build these type of models. </p>
