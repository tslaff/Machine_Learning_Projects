<h2> Description</h2>
<p> This is a basic example of how to use a Naïve Bayes classifier to predict the direction of Apple stock. 
We will build a very simple model that uses the day of the week and a moving average cross to predict 
whether the day’s price will close up or down. We don't expect this model to perform well
on new, out-of-sample data with purpose being to demonstrate how to build these type of models. </p>
