<h2> Description</h2>
<p> This is a basic example of how to use an Artificial Neuarl Network to model the S&P 500 daily returns. 
We will build a very simple model that uses four technical indicators to predict
the numeric returns. I don't expect this model to perform well on new, out-of-sample data with the purpose being to 
demonstrate how to build these type of models. </p>
